# Qortium Video

A video publishing and playback Q-App for the Qortium ecosystem. Upload, watch,
rate, comment on, and organize videos into playlists, published as QDN resources.

Built to be forked — see [Naming](#naming) below.

## Build

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Output is a single HTML file at `dist/index.html`, ready to publish as a Qortium APP.

## Home Display Settings

When launched from Qortium Home, the app reads display settings from render URL
params and live `postMessage` events: `theme`, `accent`, `textSize`, `lang`, and
`uiStyle`.

`uiStyle` supports `classic` and `modern`. Missing or unknown values default to
`classic`, matching Home's QDN app contract. Classic uses the bundled Lexend font,
Home-style green-tinted tokens, and wider layouts; Modern preserves the original
MUI/Inter-centered design.

When changing app styling, keep the existing `useIframeListener` -> state atoms ->
theme/token provider path intact, and verify both styles with `npm run build`.

## Naming

The name this app publishes under is set in `src/apps.ts`:

```ts
video: { qdn: 'Video', label: 'Video' },
```

Change `qdn` to whatever name you've registered on your network, then publish under that name. Update the same registry entry in any other apps that link to this one.
